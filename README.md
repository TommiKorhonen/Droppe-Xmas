Fun project that I finished. Made for desktop currently. Might add mobile styling later.
This project is wishlist app. In the app there are 5 carts and in each cart there are items that the children has chosen. The parent (user) is the one who can accept and decline the items. After choosing the items the user can see the accepted/declined items in the cart and the savings. Then the user can go to the final screen and see the accepted items in the final cart and the total price, after that user can choose to submit the purchase.

What I learned? :
* Making components more reusable
* Redux state handling
* Handling bigger project and more about testing

This project was very good for me, because it made my programming skills more solid and I learned many techniques from it.
